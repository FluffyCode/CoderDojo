download and unzip the example lesson for week 3:
	http://bit.ly/dojo-3

(working in objects.js)

add line 10 (below) into function pitframe()'s if-statement:

function pitframe() {
	if (character.interesct(pit)) {
		resetGame()
	}
}

this will reset the game if our character falls into the pit!

then, just below 'pit' in objects.js is 'pot' - and just below that is a section for flowers.
ignore 'pot' for now - we'll get back to it later.

in the flowers section:
	play around with flowers.x and flowers.y to change where our flowers appear on our map

now, back to our pot!
add line 28 (below) to get the pot to appear when we walk over the flowers:

function flowersframe() {
	if (character.intersect(flowers) && !potVisible) {
		potVisible = true
		game.rootScene.addChild(pot)
	}
}

looking at our sprite sheet, we see that the sprite number for the treasure box is 25
try adding a treasure box object somewhere on your map (in objects.js)
